## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3006](http://localhost:3006) to view it in the browser.

#### Notes:

I was able to get most of the functionality working other than the brush control. It would take a decent amount of 
investigation into the d3 library in order for me to arrive at a good solution.
